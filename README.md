# t


`t` is an minimalistic tool to take notes.

## Philosophy

Instead of using a web editor or something like an web editor, or an
fully bloated app to take your notes and store them on someone's server
with their proprietary software and APIs we choose to use something way
more simple, a combination of bunch of very well documented and trusted
tools, *git* and *markdown*.

## Design

`t` is designed to be completely simple and out of your way. Especially
when taking notes, sometimes all you want is somewhere to drop a bunch
of thoughts.

When writing a note, `t` will open your `EDITOR` (we recommend vim). As
soon that you write all you need and quit the app, `t` will push your
note to the configured git server. That's it.
